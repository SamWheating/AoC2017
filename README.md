### 2017 Advent of Code

I'm re-doing last year's [advent of code](www.adventofcode.com) in Go!

Took on this challenge as a way to improve my fluency with Go syntax while getting some practice solving interesting problems.

I'm also completing the 2018 Advent of Code challenges as they come out, but I'm using python for this in the interests of faster solutions and this higher scores.
